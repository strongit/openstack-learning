A set of simple oslo.messaging clients. You can use these clients to
play with the oslo.messaging API.

Clients:
--------

rpc-server - Listens for RPC requests and sends replies.
rpc-client - Sends RPC requests to an RPC server.
listener - Listens for notification messages.
notifier - Sends notification messages.

Use the --help option for more detail.

For more info on Openstack and oslo.messaging, see:

Not officially part of the olso.messaging project, just my own sandbox
to play in.

RUNNING
-------

1) run a local instance of a rabbitmq

2) make sure your python environment has oslo.messaging available.  If
it does not, you can use the config.sh script to set up a virtual
environment:

$ source config.sh

You can then run the clients from within this environment.  Remember
to use the 'deactivate' command to exit the environment when done!

3) run a server (best to do this in its own dedicated terminal as it blocks):

$ ./rpc-server --url rabbit://127.0.0.1 Server01
$ ./rpc-server --url rabbit://guest:guest@127.0.0.1 Server01
Running server, name=Server01 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace

4) run the client, invoking "methodA" on topic "my-topic" with
arguments "arg1" and "arg2":

$ ./rpc-client methodA arg1 arg2
> $ ./rpc-client echo test=10

Calling server on topic my-topic, server=None exchange=my-exchange namespace=my-namespace fanout=None

See the source for the server (rpc-server) for the RPC methods it supports.

You can set the oslo.messaging configuration values by passing the
clients a configuration file.  Use the --oslo-config <file> parameter.

Example: to configure the rpc-server with values from ./configs/rpc-server.conf:

./rpc-server.py --oslo-config ./configs/rpc-server.conf MyServer
